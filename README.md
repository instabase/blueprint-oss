# Blueprint

Blueprint is a declarative extraction language for semi-structured documents.
Users describe their documents using constraints, and Blueprint's engine solves
the constraint systems to produce extractions.

For example:

```
extract(
  text_equals("Neil Patel")('patel_label'),
  is_dollar_amount('patel_revenue'),
  bottom_aligned('patel_label', 'patel_revenue'),
  text_equals("Annual $")('annual_revenue_label'),
  right_aligned('annual_revenue_label', 'patel_revenue'))

    +
```
![sample document](./assets/sample_document.jpg)
```
= {
  'patel_label': "Neil Patel",
  'annual_revenue_label': "Annual $",
  'patel_revenue': "$79,280"
}
```

Blueprint can be used from the command line.

We also provide Studio, an experimental, interactive GUI for labeling training
data, automatically synthesizing Blueprint constraint systems from labeled
data, tweaking synthesized Blueprint programs or building them from scratch
interactively, running them against test data, and debugging.

# Setup

Start by cloning this repo to your machine.

## Python environment

### `venv`

You will need to install several Python packages. It is recommended that you
do this in a Python virtual environment, created using the Python `venv` module.
If you know what that means and how to do it, you can skip the rest of this
section.

If not, your choices are:

- Learn about `venv`: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>
- Or, execute all of the commands below without creating/activating a virtual
  environment. The required packages will be installed globally on your machine
  (or globally to your user account on your machine). This isn't necessarily a
  problem, but a virtual environment keeps things tidy.
- Or, blindly follow the instructions in this paragraph. From the root of this
  repo, execute `python3 -m venv .venv` to create a virtual environment in a
  subdirectory called `.venv`, then execute `. .venv/bin/activate` to activate
  the virtual environment. Do this second step (the activate step) for every
  terminal you use to interact with the repo (starting the Studio server, etc.).

### `PYTHONPATH`

Add `path/to/blueprint-oss/blueprint/py` and `path/to/blueprint-oss/server/py`
to your `PYTHONPATH`. In most shells (Bash/Zsh), this can be accomplished by
running:

```
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:path/to/blueprint-oss/blueprint/py:path/to/blueprint-oss/server/py"
```

For how to make this happen every time you start a new terminal, see:
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3402168/permanently-add-a-directory-to-pythonpath>

## Requirements

Install the Python requirements (ideally from within your `venv`) by running:

```
pip3 install -r python_requirements.txt
```

## JavaScript environment

If you are just using Blueprint's CLI, you can skip this section.

To run Studio, you will need to have Node/`npm` installed. There is probably
some minimum version but I'm not sure what it is. These instructions have been
tested using Node v17.0.1.

These instructions use `npm`, but `yarn` should also work.

## Requirements for Studio

Install Studio's JavaScript requirements (this will happen locally to the repo
automatically, and will not touch the rest of your machine):

```
cd studio
npm install
```

# Running Blueprint

## CLI

Blueprint provides a command-line interface. To run on a sample paystub:

```
cd examples/paystubs
python3 paystubs.py run_model -v -g ocr/*
```

To generate OCR for your own document samples, see:
<https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/drag-and-drop>

# Running Studio

Studio is an interactive GUI application for inspecting document samples and
creating, running, testing, and debugging Blueprint extraction programs/models.

To use Studio, you will need to start a server hosting the frontend, and a
server hosting the backend.

## Frontend

The Studio frontend is a single-page web application written in
TypeScript/React. To start the server:

```
cd studio
npm start
```

## Backend

The Studio backend is a thin wrapper around the Blueprint Python module, which
allows the Studio frontend to execute Blueprint models and display the results.
To start the backend, run:

```
python3 -m bp_server
```

During development, it can be useful to turn on auto-reloading for the backend
server. This can be done by launching it like so:

```
FLASK_ENV=development python3 -m bp_server
```

## Example usage

Once you have started both the frontend and backend servers, open a browser to
`http://localhost:3000`. You should see the Studio welcome screen.

Click on the instructions button and read the instructions carefully. You can
make a copy of the `examples/paystubs` directory and use the copy as your
project directory -- then you should be able to view sample paystubs in the GUI.

Studio does not use Python-based Blueprint programs (for example, the reference
extraction program `paystubs.py`). You will need to make a new model.

## Themes

There are two color schemes available for Studio. Toggling between
them must be done manually. The default is the dark color scheme. To
switch to the light color scheme, run the following command. You may
need to restart the front-end development server.

```
cp studio/src/components/LightTheme.css studio/src/components/Theme.css
```
